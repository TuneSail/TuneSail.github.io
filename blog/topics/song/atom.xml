<p>The first time I heard this song on the radio, I pulled over so that I could find it on my mobile and listen to it a second time. You may have had a different experience during your childhood and high school years, but I can personally relate to these lyrics in a big way. The music is fantastic, too &ndash; It&rsquo;s written by Yann Tiersen, who is the composer behind the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0211915/">Amélie</a> soundtrack.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s some background on the song, from <a href="http://www.sagefrancis.net/the-best-of-times-lyrics-behind-the-scenes-wordage">sagefrancis.net</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>I listened to the instrumental repeatedly waiting for images or words to pop into my head. Nothing came. As a last ditch effort I referenced an old letter I had written to my girlfriend while I was touring Europe a few years back. The first line in that letter was, “It’s been a long and lonely trip but I’m glad I took it.” I borrowed that first line for my song and the rest of the song flowed from there. I didn’t have time to filter much. What resulted was a string of raw and revealing moments from my upbringing that seem to have molded my adulthood. Vulnerable and embarrassing tidbits of info that sit in the back of my head at all times. Fuck it. That was my mentality. Fuck it. When all was said and done I felt very satisfied with the outcome. In fact, the thesis of the song seems to be about how we tend to fool ourselves into thinking that the tough and embarrassing moments of our life are much bigger than they actually are. Especially as kids, when we believe that every obstacle we encounter seems like the end of the world. That’s probably the greatest lie of our lives. It’s a lie that is so convincing that some of us kill ourselves over it. It’s important to remember that when all seems lost it really isn’t. As the old credo goes, “This too shall pass.”</p></blockquote>

<p>And my favorite lyrics, from the end:</p>

<blockquote><p>“Don’t listen when they tell you that these are your best years. Don’t let anybody protect your ears. It’s best that you hear what they don’t want you to hear. It’s better to have pressure from peers than not have peers. Beer won’t give you chest hair. Spicy food won’t make it curl. When you think you’ve got it all figured out and then your universe collapses…trust me, kid…it’s not the end of the world.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Tolga Gurpinar is a Turkish electronic music producer who releases his music under the name iLoyd. I discovered <a href="http://iloyd.com/">iLoyd.com</a> when I first started making music, and found the great <a href="(http://iloyd.com/ilosynth/index.php">VST instrument</a> that he wrote. Tolga is also a graphic designer and photographer, and I remember being fascinated by his <a href="http://iloyd.com/galleries.htm">photo galleries</a>.</p>

<p>I also loved reading his <a href="http://iloyd.com/whoisiloyd.htm">Who is Iloyd?</a> page, where he describes his childhood in Turkey, and his first musical instruments.</p>

<p>While I enjoy listening to all of iLoyd&rsquo;s music, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/iloyd/sets/alive">Alive</a> is my favorite album, and this post is about the title track. I remember reading an interview where Tolga said that he worked on this track for 3 months, and strived to perfect the sound design and harmonization.</p>

<p><a href="http://iloyd.com/interviews.htm">A review from Jeremy Robertsen</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Alive&rsquo; is like opening an inflatable life raft between your headphones, then stepping out into the garden of Eden where everything is beautiful and a bit sassy.</p></blockquote>

<p>That&rsquo;s what I like to imagine when I put on a pair of headphones and listen to this beautiful track.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t even care that Michael Bublé&rsquo;s fanbase is mostly middle-aged women. I&rsquo;m not ashamed to admit that I love this song, and Michael Bublé&rsquo;s version is incredible. Were I not so confident in my manhood, I might have posted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmwRQqJsegw">Muse&rsquo;s version</a> instead. Listen to whichever one floats your boat.</p>

<p>I used to love falling asleep to this song when I was younger. Such a beautiful, creative, and simple arrangement, and the lyrics are pure poetry.</p>
