Dream Theater is a progressive metal band, and all of the band members are insanely talented. I love all their music, and I've even flown to a different country to see them perform live.

I really love the solos near the the end of "Solitary Shell", on the album "Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence". The guitar and piano playing is amazing, and I think the melodies are beautiful. Listen to the whole song if you like, but the video below starts at my favorite time.

[Overture 1928](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNKjuC2kSPs) is another great Dream Theater song, if you want to listen to some more. [Dance of Eternity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhedP71N9gQ) is Dream Theater's most complex piece, with over 128 time signature changes. Finally, if you have 24 minutes to spare, [Octavarium](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVMIk3xYaYo) is Dream Theater's longest song, and a great introduction to the band.
