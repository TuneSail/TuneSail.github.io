Tolga Gurpinar is a Turkish electronic music producer who releases his music under the name iLoyd. I discovered [iLoyd.com](http://iloyd.com/) when I first started making music, and found the great [VST instrument]((http://iloyd.com/ilosynth/index.php) that he wrote. Tolga is also a graphic designer and photographer, and I remember being fascinated by his [photo galleries](http://iloyd.com/galleries.htm).

I also loved reading his [Who is Iloyd?](http://iloyd.com/whoisiloyd.htm) page, where he describes his childhood in Turkey, and his first musical instruments.

While I enjoy listening to all of iLoyd's music, [Alive](https://soundcloud.com/iloyd/sets/alive) is my favorite album, and this post is about the title track. I remember reading an interview where Tolga said that he worked on this track for 3 months, and strived to perfect the sound design and harmonization.

I love this [review from Jeremy Robertsen](http://iloyd.com/interviews.htm):

> 'Alive' is like opening an inflatable life raft between your headphones, then stepping out into the garden of Eden where everything is beautiful and a bit sassy.

And that's what I like to imagine when I put on a pair of headphones and listen to this song.
