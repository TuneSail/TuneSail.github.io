I don't even care that Michael Bublé's fanbase is mostly middle-aged women. I'm not ashamed to admit that I love this song, and Michael Bublé's version is incredible. Were I not so confident in my manhood, I might have posted [Muse's version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmwRQqJsegw) instead. Listen to whichever one floats your boat.
