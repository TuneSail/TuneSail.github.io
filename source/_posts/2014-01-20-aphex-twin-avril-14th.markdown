To truly appreciate this song, you really need to listen to it within the context of the [Drukqs album](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Drukqs/203084). This album has some of Aphex Twin's harshest music, and some of the first few tracks are especially grating. But when you make it through, it's such a relief to be treated with this beautiful piano solo.

From [Reddit user BobbyDafro](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/11b0pq/aphex_twin_avril_14th/c6l1kf6):

> When I was in Iraq (used to be in the Marines) we used to do the Aphex challenge which was to get into your sleeping bag, put your head phones on, zip it up completey and listen to the whole album. It was intense.
