To truly appreciate this song, you really need to listen to it within the context of the [Drukqs album](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Drukqs/203084). This album has some of Aphex Twin's harshest music, and some of the first few tracks are especially grating. But when you make it through, it's such a relief to be treated with this beautiful piano solo.
