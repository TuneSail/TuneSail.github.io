This song is one of my only hipster credentials, where I can say I "liked it before it was cool". I remember back in 2012, when I heard it for the first time on [95bFM](http://www.95bfm.com/) in Auckland, New Zealand, and just loved every second of it. I still have the message on my iPhone where I texted the radio station and asked them for the name of that song about bees. And I still have the terrible Drum & Bass remix that I made, which I thought would sound awesome, but actually didn't.

Anyhow, I really love this song, and I love how it became a huge hit in the U.S. just after I moved to San Francisco. Co-incidence? Who can really know for sure.
